- think about the statusbar/multithreading.
    Three shared TVars:
        windowTitle :: TVar String
        workspace   :: TVar Int
        statusText  :: TVar String
    Three threads:
        Main thread, handles all of the events that it handles now.  When
        necessary, it writes to workspace or windowTitle

        Status IO thread, the algorithm is something like this:
            forever $ do
                s <- getLine
                atomic (writeTVar statusText s)

        Statusbar drawing thread, waits for changes in all three TVars, and
        redraws whenever it finds a change.
