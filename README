            xmonad : a lightweight X11 window manager.

Motivation:

    dwm is great, but we can do better, building a more robust,
    more correct window manager in fewer lines of code, using strong
    static typing. Enter Haskell.

    If the aim of dwm is to fit in under 2000 lines of C, the aim of
    xmonad is to fit in under 500 lines of Haskell with similar functionality.

    X11             http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/X11-1.2
        (Unfortunately X11-1.2 does not work correctly on AMD64.  The latest
         darcs version from http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/X11 does.)

    mtl             http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mtl-1.0
    unix            http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/unix-2.0 (included with ghc)

    X11-extras:     darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/~sjanssen/X11-extras

    dmenu   2.{5,6,7} http://www.suckless.org/download/dmenu-2.7.tar.gz

And then build with Cabal:

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=/home/dons
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install

Then add:

         exec /home/dons/bin/xmonad

    to the last line of your .xsession file
