- tasks before 0.1:
    - Code clean up after tiling and StackSet changes
    - Make sure the quickchecks make sense with the new StackSet

- think about the statusbar/multithreading.
    Three shared TVars:
        windowTitle :: TVar String
        workspace   :: TVar Int
        statusText  :: TVar String
    Three threads:
        Main thread, handles all of the events that it handles now.  When
        necessary, it writes to workspace or windowTitle

        Status IO thread, the algorithm is something like this:
            forever $ do
                s <- getLine
                atomic (writeTVar statusText s)

        Statusbar drawing thread, waits for changes in all three TVars, and
        redraws whenever it finds a change.

- tiling:
    - Layout calculation: the current algorithm is crude, windows overlap
        - windows slightly overlap on i386, do not overlap on amd64,
          implies that it's not xmonad's fault?
    - make focus remain between workspace switches
    - change focus in the StackSet structure on EnterNotify
    - let mod+enter demote a master window

- Xinerama bugs:
    - Closing the last window in a workspace moves focus to another Xinerama
      screen.
    - Focus goes to other Xinerama screen when changing to empty window and
      create new window.
    - Focus doesn't always follow mouse or mouse click across Xinerama screens;
      sometimes focus will only switch with key command to switch to that
      screen.
