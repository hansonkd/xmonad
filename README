            thunk : a lightweight X11 window manager.

Motivation:

    dwm is great, but we can do better, building a more robust,
    more correct window manager in less lines of code, using strong
    static typing. Enter Haskell.

    If the aim of dwm is to fit in under 2000 lines of C, the aim of dwm
    is to fit in under 500 lines of Haskell with similar functionality.
